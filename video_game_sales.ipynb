Furthermore, there is a significant increase in game production after 1993. A possible explanation for this trend could be an increasing popularity of video games as platforms became more accessible and technologically advanced.

Priority for advertisements should be given to modern generation console platforms, specifically the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. These platforms are in their nascency and their predecessors (PS3 and X360) were historically the most successful. In terms of game genre, the most successful in almost every region were Shooters, Sports, and Platformers, and thus should also be prioritized.\n","\n","By exception, advertisement campaigns can avoid titles that received a poor score from professional critics. While high scores showed minimal affect on sales, lower scores (less than 60, or 6) negatively impacted overall sales. \n","\n","While these trends are accurate for North America and Europe, if advertisements are regionalized, priorities in platform selection may need to adjust for a campaign in Japan. Neither the PS4 and Xbox One appeared to be profitible in this region, and priority should be given to other platforms, specifically modern generation hand-helds according to historical data."]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3 (ipykernel)","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.11.1"},"toc":{"base_numbering":1,"nav_menu":{},"number_sections":true,"sideBar":true,"skip_h1_title":true,"title_cell":"Table of Contents","title_sidebar":"Contents","toc_cell":false,"toc_position":{},"toc_section_display":true,"toc_window_display":false},"vscode":{"interpreter":{"hash":"2acc139864183d3ac83c310a405f58714beffd069d122ecf4c167777b3a3f96a"}}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":2}
